### Day0 August 13, Monday

**Today's work**: Working on understanding Javascript Variables

**Thoughts** Have been declaring variables but working on understanding All about javascript variable declaration using the ES6 let and const


**Link to work**: [Andrew Mead Modern Js Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript/?couponCode=LEARNING)

##Day 1 August 14 ,Tuesday

**Today's work**: Continued with variable scope

**Thoughts** The scope of a variable is where a variable can be acessed,so you can't declare a variable anywhere and expect to access it if it is not in scope or within the parent scope

## Day 2 August 15, Wednesday

**Today's work**: Started working with functions

**Thoughts** Functions are actually subprograms that can be used and called in another program reducing code duplication

## Day 3 August 16, Thursday 

**Today's work**: Worked on Multiple and default arguments in functions and Template strings
 **Thoughts** Learnt how to work with multiple arguments and how to pass default arguments and how to use template strings to join strings together for netter formatting creating neater codes

 ## Day 4 August 17, Friday

 **Today's work** Started working with objects

 **Thoughts** Objects allows us to store related piece of information in a single central location which makes use of key value pairs

 ##Days 5 August 18, Saturday
 **Today's work** Continued with Javascript object methods
 **Thoughts** Methods in objects are object properties whose value is a function, inside the method we have access to "this" references the object the method is defined on, it also helps to access properties inside an object, also working with const which means constant it says that you can't reassign a constant variable after it has been created, when working with object you can manipulate the object but not reassign the object 
 Also going back to var based variables which are function scope and not block scoped,when you create a variable with var,its declaration gets hoisted to the top

 ##Day 6 August 19, Sunday
 **Todays work** Started learning how to work with arrays
 **Thoughts**Arrays allows us to store list of information, the index of an array is the position of the array we want to access which is zero based, the shift and unshift manipulates the array from the start, while shift and unshift starts from the first

 ##Day 7 August 27, Monday
 **Todays work** Looping over an array
 **Thoughts** There are array methods that allow you to loop through an array without using the normal for loop such as The for each method a function which is called for every item in the array

 ##Day 8 August 28 ,Tuesday -Day 14 September 3

 **work** Searching An array[Array Methods]
 **Thoughts** The Array.indexof Is a useful array method to locate an item in an array, it returns the index of the array if it exists but returns negative one if it does not exist, i also learnt that when comparing two objects, it does not matter if they have the same object, What makes two object equal is if they are the same object in memory, FindIndex if it finds a match it stops running and returns a match, I also looked into the Array find method that finds the search element instead of the index as to that of the findIndex that meets the search criteria but it returns the first value if there are alot of options that meet the criteria.
 Also saw how to sort an array using the array.sort method,in comparing two alphabets the capitalization is important eg "A" will come before "a"("A" < "a");

 ##Day 15 September 4
 **Todays Work** DOM 
 **Thoughts** DOM which stands for document object model is a object in javascript that models the html document, the object in the dom is the document object it is not self created but it is provided by the browser, we also get elements in the DOM by quering it eg by using document.querySelector which matches the first match it finds. I also looked at textContent which is a property used  to read value the dom element
 Also looked at how to add elements to the DOM using the document.createElement and appendChild and how to handle user interactions via event handlers,events which is basically what the user does. The event is called with an argument which is useful when you want to do something with the element that the event is fired on 

##Day 16 September 5
**Todays work** DOM Contd
**Thoughts**I dived into advanced DOM quering which comprises of targeting elements using their id's and classes. ID's are unique identifier that you give to your elements, they are unique at least one element in your page,multiple elements can have the same class

##Day17 September 6
**Todays work**DOM Contd
**Thoughts** I started rendering my filtered data for both my journal app and todo app by saving it in an object and setting up the function to re-render when there is a change. 

##Day 18 September 7
**Todays work** Set up the search filter for the todo app
**Thoughts** Wired up the filter search text for the todo app, same set up for the journal app
