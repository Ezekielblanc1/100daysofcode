**Link to work**: [Andrew Mead Modern Js Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript/?couponCode=LEARNING)

##Day 1 August 14 ,Tuesday

**Today's work**: Continued with variable scope

**Thoughts** The scope of a variable is where a variable can be acessed,so you can't declare a variable anywhere and expect to access it if it is not in scope or within the parent scope

## Day 2 August 15, Wednesday

**Today's work**: Started working with functions

**Thoughts** Functions are actually subprograms that can be used and called in another program reducing code duplication

## Day 3 August 16, Thursday 

**Today's work**: Worked on Multiple and default arguments in functions and Template strings
 **Thoughts** Learnt how to work with multiple arguments and how to pass default arguments and how to use template strings to join strings together for netter formatting creating neater codes

 ## Day 4 August 17, Friday

 **Today's work** Started working with objects

 **Thoughts** Objects allows us to store related piece of information in a single central location which makes use of key value pairs

 ##Days 5 August 18, Saturday
 **Today's work** Continued with Javascript object methods
 **Thoughts** Methods in objects are object properties whose value is a function, inside the method we have access to "this" references the object the method is defined on, it also helps to access properties inside an object, also working with const which means constant it says that you can't reassign a constant variable after it has been created, when working with object you can manipulate the object but not reassign the object 
 Also going back to var based variables which are function scope and not block scoped,when you create a variable with var,its declaration gets hoisted to the top
